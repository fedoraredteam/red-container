From the Wiki:

>Adoption of the Open Container Image Format is changing the packaging landscape. RPMs are still useful, but getting community adoption and participation in a containerization effort is easier than that of a packaging effort.
>
The Red Container project will work on containerizing the popular tooling in Kali Linux so that they can be run from any Linux distro, including Fedora, CentOS, and RHEL.
>
Initial focus will be given to pentesting tools not already packaged in the Fedora repos or in EPEL such as:
>
    Metasploit Framework
    nikto
    cewl
    enum4linux
    nbtscan
>
Other tools will be added after that, including a controlled interface to install package groups similar to those of Kali, and to invoke those tools from the CLI without having to call `docker run`.
